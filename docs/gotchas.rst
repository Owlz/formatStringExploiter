Hanging on Write
================
There are a few reasons for hanging on write. Check the following:

* Check your format string harness waiting on input.
* Check your ``badChars`` input to the FormatString class. Depending on how your program recieves input, it may have different characters to avoid.
* If you are using ``pwntools`` to communicate with the application, be sure to add ``buffer_fill_size=0xffff`` to the setup line, such as ``p = process("./a.out",buffer_fill_size=0xffff``.

On the last, there is currently a limitation in how ``pwntools`` handles recieving input where it will only recieve a maximum of 4096 characters. When writing large values, you will write up to 65535 characters, thus this argument is needed. At time of writing, this change is in a pull request and not yet in ``pwntools`` proper. If you are having issues, use my fork of ``pwntools`` as it has this change integrated. https://github.com/owlz/pwntools
