# formatStringExploiter
Helper script for working with format string bugs

# Overview
It's built to be both a python library and console application. For python, just import it.

This tool only supports i386 at the moment.

For quick start, just type 
```bash
$ make
$ ./formatStringExploiter.py formatStringTest
```

# Dependencies
You will need pwntools and prettytable

```bash
mkvirtualenv pwntools
pip install pwntools
pip install prettytable
```

# Examples
